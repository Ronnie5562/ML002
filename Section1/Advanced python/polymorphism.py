# Polymorphism in Python refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. This means that objects of different classes can be treated 
# as if they were of the same class, allowing for more flexible and dynamic code. Polymorphism is achieved in Python through method overriding and 
# method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method already defined in its superclass, while 
# method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist within the same class. This enables Python
# code to be more modular and easier to maintain.

# Program to overload multiplication operator to work on Employee objects:

class Employer:
    def __init__(self, name, wage):
        self.name = name
        self.wage = wage

    def __mul__(self, other):
        return self.wage * other.days

class Timesheet:
    def __init__(self, name, days):
        self.name = name
        self.days = days


E = Employer('Ronald', 300000)
T = Timesheet('Ronald', 24)

This_month_salary =  E * T

print(f'This monh salary: {This_month_salary}')


# There is a limitation to all the codes above, guess what's that?
# The overloading methods - e.g {__add__(self)} can only add two variables of a class. When we input three, it throws an error
#To solve this problem, we have to modify the methods. ==> Check the code below


class Book:
    def __init__(self, pages) -> None:
        self.pages = pages
        
        # Keep an eye on the code directly below this and notice the difference
    def __add__(self, other):
        result = self.pages + other.pages
        b = Book(result)
        return b
    # The code above adds up the number of pages in each Book instance that is added with the '+' operator
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f'The total number of pages you are to read is: {self.pages}. You can do it, bro ðŸ’ª'

book1 = Book(200)

# Method overriding:
# What ever members available in the parent class are bydefault available to the child class through
# inheritance. If the child class not satisfied with parent class implementation then child class is
# allowed to redefine that method in the child class based on its requirement. This concept is called
# overriding.
# Overriding concept applicable for both methods and constructors  -- durga
