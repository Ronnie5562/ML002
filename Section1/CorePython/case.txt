Changing case of a String:
We can change case of a string by using the following 4 methods.
1. upper()===>To convert all characters to upper case
2. lower() ===>To convert all characters to lower case
3. swapcase()===>converts all lower case characters to upper case and all upper case characters to
lower case
4. title() ===>To convert all character to title case. i.e first character in every word should be upper
case and all remaining characters should be in lower case.
5. capitalize() ==>Only first character will be converted to upper case and all remaining characters
can be converted to lower case
Eg:
s='learning Python is very Easy'
print(s.upper())
print(s.lower())
print(s.swapcase())
print(s.title())
print(s.capitalize())
Output:
LEARNING PYTHON IS VERY EASY
learning python is very easy
LEARNING pYTHON IS VERY eASY
Learning Python Is Very Easy
Learning python is very easy


To check type of characters present in a string:
Python contains the following methods for this purpose.
1) isalnum(): Returns True if all characters are alphanumeric( a to z , A to Z ,0 to9 )
2) isalpha(): Returns True if all characters are only alphabet symbols(a to z,A to Z)
3) isdigit(): Returns True if all characters are digits only( 0 to 9)
4) islower(): Returns True if all characters are lower case alphabet symbols
5) isupper(): Returns True if all characters are upper case aplhabet symbols
6) istitle(): Returns True if string is in title case
7) isspace(): Returns True if string contains only spaces


Eg:
print('Durga786'.isalnum()) #True
print('durga786'.isalpha()) #False
print('durga'.isalpha()) #True
print('durga'.isdigit()) #False
print('786786'.isdigit()) #True
print('abc'.islower()) #True
print('Abc'.islower()) #False
print('abc123'.islower()) #True
print('ABC'.isupper()) #True
print('Learning python is Easy'.istitle()) #False
print('Learning Python Is Easy'.istitle()) #True
print(' '.isspace()) #True
