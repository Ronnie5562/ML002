Changing case of a String:
We can change case of a string by using the following 4 methods.
1. upper()===>To convert all characters to upper case
2. lower() ===>To convert all characters to lower case
3. swapcase()===>converts all lower case characters to upper case and all upper case characters to
lower case
4. title() ===>To convert all character to title case. i.e first character in every word should be upper
case and all remaining characters should be in lower case.
5. capitalize() ==>Only first character will be converted to upper case and all remaining characters
can be converted to lower case
Eg:
s='learning Python is very Easy'
print(s.upper())
print(s.lower())
print(s.swapcase())
print(s.title())
print(s.capitalize())
Output:
LEARNING PYTHON IS VERY EASY
learning python is very easy
LEARNING pYTHON IS VERY eASY
Learning Python Is Very Easy
Learning python is very easy
